I'm considering to upgrade my pc on the cpu side a bit. I now have:

- i3 4160
- gtx 1060
- itx case and itx mobo
- 8gb ddr3 ram
- 1080p monitor

I feel my haswell i3 is bottlenecking my 1060 a bit playing mass effect: andromeda. I'm satisfied with other games I'm playing right now, although they are a bit older titles (Witcher 3) and indie games.

What would be a relatively cheap and worthwhile upgrade for me?

Cheap mobos for 8th gen are not available yet. Itx form factor is adding a premium too. I may consider moving to mAtx, which means I have to buy a new case, but mAtx is easier to upgrade in the future than itx.

Or should I just get an itx 7th gen cpu+mobo, or wait for cheap 8th gen mobos to come out?
